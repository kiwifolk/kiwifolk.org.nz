Description from Frank Povah: "It's from the NZ Women's Weekly (I kid you
not) sometime in the 70s at the old Canterbury University soon after the
long battle that saw it saved as an arts centre. In the pic are Anne
Davies and Frank Scaglione (bending over) and me. Seated (that I can
remember) are Sue Lutkenhouse (closest to Frank S) and Peter Meredith[?]"
