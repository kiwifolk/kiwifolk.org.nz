### Beltona Resonator Instruments

Web page: <a href="http://www.beltona.net/">http://www.beltona.net/</a>

Beltona is a partnership between Steve Evans and Bill Johnson that began in the UK
in 1990. A luthier and engineer respectively and sharing an interest in resonator
instruments, we set out to produce a couple of instruments for ourselves.  Bill
was intrigued by the idea of making musical instruments out of metal and Steve
had developed an expertise in resonator instrument repair and restoration so had
access to many original instruments.  We wanted to replicate the original
features we liked and decided to make adjustments and improvements as well. In
addition, we were committed to producing all components of each instrument
ourselves.  As a result of this, a business grew which has been producing the
finest quality, handcrafted instruments ever since. Beltona is a small and highly
specialised enterprise which relies on the individual and complementary skills of
these two people who are committed to the uniqueness of each instrument and to
the development of resonator instruments generally.

process which will last a life-time. Working on instruments that are older
than myself, and will long outlive me is my constant reminder of the huge

is therfore to always produce work to the highest of standards, and using

### Celtic Connexions

Web page:
<a href="http://www.celt.co.nz/">http://www.celt.co.nz</a>

Celtic Connexions started in Te Aroha in 2004 and has been born out of the need by
the owner to obtain local Celtic goods here in New Zealand.

Being a specialist shop, I suppose it was inevitable that a city location was on
the cards and so the move was made April 06 and now here we are in Claudlands on
the edge of Hamilton city.

I'm passionate about all types of music - a player not just of Highland bagpipes
but smallpipes ,whistles and now that I'm learning  the Irish Uillean Pipes,
has brought a dream come true of 20 years to own and operate a shop.

Visits hame to the old land, and also the sourcing of new products is fun.

And its not just the  Scottish stuff thats fun sourcing.  Welsh, Irish, Manx,
Cornish, Breton and Galician  items are on the list too.

### Mitchell's Bagpipe Centre

Web page: <a href="http://www.kilts.co.nz/">http://www.kilts.co.nz/</a>

A piper for 50 years, I play the highland bagpipe and highland small-pipes.
Bagpipes have been my music passion since I was 15. Mainly in pipe bands,
but I also have played in many solo piping situations (NZ and overseas) for
dancing as well as in Celtic music sessions. For the past 25 years my
piping experience has involved being a pipe-major where looking after the
setup of bagpipes and reeds for other pipers has been a necessary task.
Hence my specialising with this instrument in my business. I supply all the
necessities for learners including tuition.
