		 Field Guide to the Irish Music Session</a> by Barry Foy, Rob Adams
		  (Illustrator) US$9.07</strong>
		 <br />Hardcover - 96 pages (March 1999) Publishers' Group West.
		 <br /> Far from being a spontaneous free-for-all, the Irish music session
		  is governed by a particular	etiquette. Traditional Irish music is very
		  specific: specific tunes and rhythms, played on specific instruments.
			Being aware of the nuances --	passed from generation to generation
			through the institution of the session -- allows the player or fan to
			easily follow the music. This	book explains it all and includes a
			glossary and charming line drawings.

		Last Night's Fun : In and Out of Time With Irish Music</a> by Ciaran
		 Carson US$21.00</strong>
		<br />
		Hardcover - 198 pages (March 1997) North Point Press.
		<br />
		Review: A killer flautist and top-drawer poet, Ciaran Carson has fused
		 his twin vocations in Last Night's Fun. First and foremost, he tells the
		 reader about traditional Irish music. Yet his book is also a meditation
		 on several interlinked themes--memory, drinking, mortality, language,
		 food, and the uncanny way in which music seems to expand and contract
		 the very passage of time. Carson's prose is appropriately euphonic,
		 right down to the innumerable grace notes of wit and amusement, and he
		 has the improvisor's gift for rushing the listener down unexpected
		 paths. In short: a marvelous, inimitable read.
		</p>
		 
		<p>
		Carson's Belfast childhood, early encounters with music, and travels
		 through Ireland and America contributes to chapters which blend
		 autobiography with reflections on Irish musical style. Last Night's
		 Fun features a chatty blend of musical history and travelogue following
		 the author's encounters with popular Irish music.

		...explaining how fiddlers playing together know when one reel is going
		 to segue into the next in a set, telling you how to find the pub where
		 the music will be most freely flowing at night, and advising the best
		 way to cook eggs-and-fry the morning after. 
		</blockquote>
		
		E. Annie Proulx, author of The Shipping News
		
		<blockquote>"...cracker of a book, pure pleasure, stuffed with anecdotes,
		 memories, wit and humor and deep knowledge of traditional Irish music.
		 The reader is transported into the smoke and warmth of certain rooms
		 in Northern Ireland where a glass of whiskey stands on the table, the
		 black, cast-iron pan sputters on the burner, and a tune falls canted and
		 sly out of the instruments."

		<blockquote>
		Delvings of the deep diddly diddly, Belfast writer, fluter, raconteur and
		 unreliable witness takes us into the subterranean world of craic agus
		 chaos as he attempts to surf the web of the perfect session experience.
		 Part nostalgic interrogtation of his own relationship with traditional
		 music, part exploration of the Ulster breakfast: this book is a close
		 as it gets to the cameraderie and catharsis of an all night music bash.
		 A work of astute fiction that might never be true but is always
		 believable.
		</p>
		 
		<p>
		At the end we are left wondering was this one large joke or simply a
		 witty Northern oxymoron? A book to be revisited when the frost keeps
		 us away from session, pub or our inner fiddler.

		<p>
		Excellent is too narrow a word to describe the sweep of the narrative.

		 50 Irish Ballads</a>US$7.95</strong>
		 <br />
		 Good for what it is... This small book contains, as the title indicates,
		  the words to 50 Irish ballads that can be played using only six chords
			(G, C, D, Am, A, and Em). It does not contain the actual tunes, and
			because of this it's really only useful to people already familiar with
			the songs. The book has some good material, and I'd give it a higher
			rating if it gave some indication of where to find recorded versions
			of the songs to learn from. As it is, I plan to order the other two
			volumes in the series...but if you're not already a fan of groups like
			the Clancy Brothers and the Wolfe Tones who actually perform these
			songs you won't get much use out of it

		nolanlori@aol.com from Hawaii, September 22, 1999; The first slack-key
		 guitar book you should buy!!! This is a great book for those who never
		 played a guitar before. Once I got the guitar tuned to slack key I
		 could actually start playing the first song. It is hard to believe
		 that nice music can be made by pressing down on just one string at a
		 time. I hope he comes out with another book with more songs to learn.

		<p>
		finemc28@aol.com from Sacramento, Ca, August 15, 1997; Wonderful
		 start to playing Hawaiian Slack Key style. After working through all
		 the songs in this book I now have a set of beautiful and playable
		 guitar pieces. Most are in G tuning and the progression from song to
		 song is excellent. The left hand fingering details are very helpful.

		A permanent reference work on my bench. ...over a 2 week period I built
		 a fabulous acoustic guitar using the step by step procedures outlined
		 in this book entirely.
		</p>
				
		<p>
		Excellent work on guitarmaking. This is a detailed, step-by-step work
		 on building a steel-string and a classical guitar, with very good
		 professional photos and drawings. It is written in a manner that
		 assumes a bit of experience, but takes the time to explain principles
		 and procedures fully in every case. If you are planning to build a
		 guitar for the first time, you'll want this one. It's worth all the
		 tools in your shop.
		</p>
				
		<p>
		"Guitarmaking..." is well written and detailed. Cumpiano and Natelson
		 have written a great book for beginners. In this book are all of the
		 details necessary for constructing your own classical or
		 steel-stringed guitar. The appendix is an indespensable resource with
		 lists of potential suppliers, wood types, and dimensions for every
		 piece. They describe the process with a minimum of technology used.
		</p>
				 
		<p>
		The gods prostrate themselves before this masterpiece. As a technical
		 writer and luthier, I can vouch for this tome on both accounts. It
		 explains guitarmaking in such detail that it does not need to include
		 any patterns; after reading this book, you will understand the
		 instrument well enough to build one on a desert island from memory.
		 Although the paperback edition is quite sturdy, I used mine until
		 it fell apart. Buy the hardback.
		</p>
				
		<p>
		Absolutely a must-have book for beginning luthiers. The instructions
		 in this book are well-thought out and very precise. I built the steel
		 string neck in two days. It came out great. The step-by-step
		 instructions left nothing to the imagination. Every step is explained
		 in detail. The authors even go so far as to anticipate your trouble
		 areas and go to extra lengths to pinpoint them and give remedy.
		</p>
				 
		<p>
		This is the book for all beginning and intermediate luthiers In the
		 research stage of my luthier career I bought quite a few books.
		 Without a doubt my favorites would be this book and Robert Benedetto's
		 "Building an Archtop Guitar". What makes this book so outstanding is
		 that it actually breaks the process down into unique steps. Most books
		 will tell you to "Plane the top plate to the correct thickness". This
		 book tells you how to do it, not just what to do. This is also the
		 only book on guitar building where the author anticipates the areas
		 where the beginning luthier might have problems. There are several
		 areas where you're told to do such and such a step (which may
		 not be obvious) in order to avoid such -and-such a problem. There's
		 also several times when the author tells you how to escape from common
		 mistakes. I own a lot of guitar building books but this is the one
		 that sits in the top of my tool chest.
		</p>
				
		<p>
		Probably the best do-it-yourself guide to making a guitar! As a chronic
		 do-it-yourselfer my intest in playing guitar has spawned an interest
		 in building a guitar. I found this tome after years of searching the
		 stacks at my local library, and I instantly fell in love with it. It
		 is quite clearly written and each step is explained in exquisite
		 detail. The authors have divided up the steps into several short
		 procedures so that the reader does not feel overwhelmed. Each
		 procedure is profusely illustrated and accompanied in most cases by
		 a list of materials and tools required. Cognizant that the lay
		 carpenter probably does not have much in the way of woodworking
		 tools, the authors pare down the list of tools needed to a manageable
		 list available at most hardware stores, mostly hand tools. The authors
		 also include an up to date list of catalog suppliers of necessary
		 parts, tools, and woods.

		Reviews:
		<br />
		howardpaul@aol.com from Savannah, GA , July 22, 1999; This is a
		 critical book for an archtop <u>buyer</u>, too! As an archtop owner
		 and player for nearly thirty years, I would call this book a must read
		 for anyone who is interested in purchasing a vintage archtop or buying
		 a new one. Benedetto leads the reader into a deep appreciation of the
		 painstaking detail that goes into The Making of an Archtop. He
		 describes the level of attention that should be evident on each
		 component of the guitar, and how it effects the player (and the price)
		 in the end. The significance of learning the process of material
		 selection, construction sequencing and design considerations might
		 well lead the reader towards a custom made instrument. This book is a
		 credit to all the independent luthiers out there whose trade is no
		 longer a secret.
		</p>
				
		<p>
		bacatmx@att.net from San Antonio , May 20, 1999; Good book for a novice
		 builder. I agree that this book is not for someone who is interested
		 in seriously studying archtop design and construction. But It's a
		 GREAT book for someone with a little experience under their belt, who
		 wants to try something different. If you want to become the next
		 "Greatest American Luthier", find a good mentor and apprentice
		 yourself to him/her. If you want to build an archtop, this book is a
		 comprehensive guide that will get you there.

		m_cameron_smith@hotmail.com from Australia, April 26,1999; THE Archtop

		 informative of it's kind. As far as not giving enough info. goes,
		 there is everything one needs to know from go to whoa. If he doesn't
		 spell it out then it can either be worked out with a little basic
		 math. or it doesn't effect the overall outcome. It is the best book
		 on archtop guitars and should be in every collection.

		<br />
		cryinmike@teleweb.net from New Baltimore Michigan, July 4, 1999; This
		 is an outstanding, very thorough book and takes the reader through all
		 the steps necessary to construct a classical or acoustic steel string
		 guitar. The book comes complete with life size plans for the parts,
		 as well as plans and instructions for building the various jigs
		 required, including the side bending jig. The book also painstakingly
		 lays out the materials and tools needed, leaving no guesswork. Being
		 brand new to building guitars, and this being my first book, I was
		 perhaps conservative in rating the book 4 stars. Time may prove this
		 to be a 5 star book, I just had a couple of questions left unanswered.
		 I do highly recommend this book, it is worth ten times the price.

		Guitar Player Repair Guide : How to Set-Up, Maintain, and Repair

		<br />
		Paperback - 309 pages 2nd edition (January 1994) Miller Freeman Books;
		 A reader from U.S.A. , April 11, 1999; This book is excellent!!!
		 Anyone who knows of Dan Erlewine(?) or has seen his repair videos
		 knows that he is a genius repairman! This book took me from knowing
		 nothing about guitar repair- to doing my own fret jobs! This book is
		 way under-priced once you realize how much money you are saving in
		 repairs. Plus, no more waiting 2 weeks to get your guitar back from
		 the shop just to realize that the bonehead who "fixed" it actually
		 totally screwed it up! In this book, Dan explains everything in
		 'real-people' terms and really lines it out for you- lots of
		 pictures!!! A MUST HAVE!

		Chris Carr, chriscarr@picknowl.com.au from Australia, September 10,
		 1998; Almost a luthiers course in a book for budding Mr Fixit's This
		 book is partly a compendium of all the excellent articles that Dan
		 Erlewine has written in the US mags over the years. A lot of the stuff
		 in the book really isn't for beginners but is still an excellent
		 reference for repairing and fine tuning your guitar, you can build
		 yourself up to that fretboard recap later. It's also great for giving
		 you the knowledge to combat the technobabble and lies that some shonky
		 repair guys throw at newbies. Honestly this book has been a real help
		 to me in my tinkering with guitars, even if just helps you do a basic
		 setup its going to save you money in repair bills in the long run.
		 The scope and detail of topics in the book is comprehensive, and
		 obviously Dan is a well respected repair jockey who can answer most
		 problems you are likely to face. He covers painting a finish, cracks
		 on acoustics, neck breaks, tuning, trussrods and action, fret
		 replacements and profiling, pickups and the list just goes on.
		 Sometimes it's hard to follow because it's very USA centric and Dan
		 recommends products, which more often than not, are just not sold in
		 Australia. If you can live with this, buy it, anyway his descriptions
		 of what the techniques are and what the products do are good enough
		 that you can translate the instructions into Australian and what's on
		 the shelves of you local hardware store. It's not a luthiers course
		 in a book, but rather an excellent reference book and a must have for
		 all budding Guitar Bruces and Mr Fixit's out there.

		Anthony Gundrum (agundrum@voicenet.com) from Bridgeport, PA, July 26,
		 1998; Excellent reference for repairing and tuning up your guitar
		 The first time I looked through this book I found it to be very
		 informative. I was sorry the next time I looked for it and could
		 not find it on the store shelf. Found it again and this time I bought
		 it. I had a Les Paul copy with a headstock that was cracked down into
		 the neck (really wierd break) and I had glued it up the best I could
		 without this book. Came out good but the problems that followed were
		 buzzing notes and intonation. I learned alot about the problems I was
		 having using this book and was able to get the guitar sounding better
		 than it ever had. A must have reference.

		A reader , April 3, 1997; Essential tool for DIY guitarists. This book
		 is essential. If you touch your guitar with anything other than a
		 polishing cloth or your fingers, Read This Book First! Comprehensive
		 in scope, exhaustive in detail, and informed by experience, Erlewine's
		 book is written colorfully and has the answer to any problem a player
		 or repairman is likely to face, whether it be finish damage,
		 structural cracks, or fine tuning the action and setup. About the
		 only place where the book is less than encyclopedic is in its
		 treatment of pickups and electronics, but even here, Erlewine covers
		 the basics and the most common problems. I have used the information
		 in this book to help me  build a guitar from scratch; it saved my
		 butt a few times. -j

		Review:
		<br />
		george_chapman@bose.com from Framingham, Massachusetts , August 28,
		 1998; Roger covers everything you need to know about building a
		 bluegrass banjo. He does an excellent job of describing the tasks
		 and the sequence that they should be done. Building a banjo is a lot
		 like swimming; easier for an expert to describe than for the novice to
		 execute. However, with Rogers step by step method, you will have to
		 work hard at screwing up. This book will save you hours of aggrivation
		 and frustration. Well worth the money. The book contains excellent
		 photos to assist the builder.
